Description:

Our dataset consists of corporate registrations for the largest 4 states in the United States, California, New York,
Florida, and Texas. These files contain the master data sets for each respective states registration records.
They contain the name of the corporation, current status of the registered corporation (active, suspended, merged out, etc.),
and other miscallaneous information. We hope to use this dataset to make connections with general economic trends
in the United States, seeing as how these states are representative of more than 1/3 of the entire U.S. population.
We can also compare this dataset to a political timeline in relation to legislation, changes in certain industries. etc.
