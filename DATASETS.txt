Description:

Our dataset consists of recent information regarding the three largest cryptocurrences, BitCoin, Etherium, and LiteCoin.
The data is extremely recent, all from the year 2019, and is from the same source. The tables track highs, lows,
volumes, and value in USD of given currencies, kept track of at an hourly rate. One of the tables is a larger
file, consisting of crypto information of various currencies, taken at 12 hour intervals. The combination of these
tables gives us a good, overall representation of the cryptocurrency market, enabling us to track fluctuations
and establish general trends. We hope to tie in this data with another relavant economic dataset, perhaps stocks 
or another large indicator of economy.
