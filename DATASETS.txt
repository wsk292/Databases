Description:

Our dataset consists of recent information regarding the three largest cryptocurrences, BitCoin, Etherium, and LiteCoin.
The data is extremely recent, all from the year 2019, and is from the same source. The tables track highs, lows,
volumes, and value in USD of given currencies, kept track of at an hourly rate. One of the tables is a larger
file, consisting of crypto information of various currencies, taken at 12 hour intervals. The combination of these
tables gives us a good, overall representation of the cryptocurrency market, enabling us to track fluctuations
and establish general trends. We hope to tie in this data with another relavant economic dataset, perhaps stocks 
or another large indicator of economy.

Dataset 2 Description:

This second dataset consists of stock information regarding Apple, Amazon, and FaceBook stocks. It also contains a fairly large 
economic calendar, which contains significant indicators of economic change, within it. The stock values are sources from Yahoo finance
while the economic calendar is sourced from Socrataca. The stock tables are largely in line with cryptocurrency tables of dataset1,
containing common indicators like open, close, high, low, values and a date. These values are recorded on a twenty four hour basis.
The economic calendar indicates a wide variety of events, which induce economic change. These can be tied into the rising/falling of
cryptocurrency/stocks to analyze trends and see if there's any correlation between the two.
