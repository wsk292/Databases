During milestone 4, the only formatting issue we encountered was changing the date column from a STRING 
to a seperate DATE and TIME primitive. That issue was taken care of using Standard SQL. There are no other formatting issues
in our dataset1. For the sake of this assignment, we will be adding a range column to our tables using Apache B.
The range column will show the difference between the open and close value of the given cryptocurrency.
